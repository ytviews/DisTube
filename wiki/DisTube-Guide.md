# Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of JavaScript. While you can create a basic music bot with limited JS knowledge, a strong foundation will help you troubleshoot issues.
- A basic Discord bot set up with Discord.js. Refer to [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) if you haven't already.

This guide assumes you're familiar with the command handling setup from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/). Adjustments may be needed based on your command handler's structure.

# Installation

1.  Install DisTube and required dependencies in your bot project:

    ```sh
    npm install distube @discordjs/voice @discordjs/opus
    ```

2.  Install FFmpeg. See the guides for:

    - [Windows](http://blog.gregzaal.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/)
    - [Linux (Ubuntu, Mint,...)](https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/)

    If the links above are unavailable, download FFmpeg from [this repo](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid using `ffmpeg-static` due to potential stability issues across different machines. Also, do NOT install the `ffmpeg` npm package. Uninstall it if installed with `npm uninstall ffmpeg`.

3. Encryption Libraries

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to install one of these libraries if your system does not support `aes-256-gcm` (verify by running `require('node:crypto').getCiphers().includes('aes-256-gcm')`).
